Simple Text Sentiment Analysis
================================

This example shows how to analyze the sentiment (emotion) of text.
It's a simplified version that teaches NLP concepts without complex libraries.

What you'll learn:
- Text preprocessing (cleaning and preparing text)
- Feature extraction (converting words to numbers)
- Sentiment classification (positive vs negative)

Use case: Determine if a movie review is positive or negative.

    1. Learns which words appear more in positive vs negative texts
    2. Calculates a "sentiment score" for each word
    3. Uses these scores to predict sentiment of new text
