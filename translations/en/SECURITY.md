## Security

Microsoft prioritizes the security of its software products and services, including all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as [Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft), [Azure](https://github.com/Azure), [DotNet](https://github.com/dotnet), [AspNet](https://github.com/aspnet), [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin), and [our GitHub organizations](https://opensource.microsoft.com/).

If you believe you've identified a security vulnerability in any Microsoft-owned repository that aligns with [Microsoft's definition of a security vulnerability](https://aka.ms/opensource/security/definition), please report it to us using the process outlined below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at [https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report](https://aka.ms/opensource/security/create-report).

If you'd prefer to submit a report without logging in, you can email [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com). Whenever possible, encrypt your message using our PGP key, which can be downloaded from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://aka.ms/opensource/security/pgpkey).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If you don't, please follow up via email to confirm we received your original message. Additional details are available at [microsoft.com/msrc](https://aka.ms/opensource/security/msrc).

Please include the following information (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the potential issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of the source file(s) related to the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration needed to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if available)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

Providing this information will help us process your report more efficiently.

If you're submitting a report for a bug bounty, more detailed reports may result in higher bounty awards. Visit our [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program](https://aka.ms/opensource/security/bounty) page for more information about our active programs.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

Microsoft adheres to the principles of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://aka.ms/opensource/security/cvd).
