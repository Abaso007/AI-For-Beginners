## The Environment

The Mountain Car environment features a car stuck in a valley. Your objective is to propel the car out of the valley and reach the flag. The available actions are accelerating to the left, accelerating to the right, or remaining idle. You can observe the car's position along the x-axis and its velocity.

## Starting Notebook

Begin the lab by opening [MountainCar.ipynb](MountainCar.ipynb)

## Key Takeaway

Throughout this lab, you should understand that adapting RL algorithms to a new environment is often quite simple, thanks to the consistent interface provided by OpenAI Gym for all environments. Additionally, RL algorithms are generally not heavily dependent on the specific nature of the environment. You can even refactor the Python code to allow any environment to be passed as a parameter to the RL algorithm.
