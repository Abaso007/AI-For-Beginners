# NetLogo Assignment

Choose one of the models from NetLogo's library and use it to simulate a real-life scenario as accurately as possible. A good example would be modifying the Virus model in the Alternative Visualizations folder to demonstrate how it can be used to model the spread of COVID-19. Can you create a model that replicates the dynamics of a real-world viral spread?

Demonstrate your work by saving a copy and creating a video demo that explains how the model relates to a real-world situation.
