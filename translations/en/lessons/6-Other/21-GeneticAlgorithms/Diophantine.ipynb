    "> This assignment is part of [AI for Beginners Curriculum](http://github.com/microsoft/ai-for-beginners) and is inspired by [this post](https://habr.com/post/128704/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to solve the so-called **Diophantine equation** - an equation with integer solutions and integer coefficients. For example, consider the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a+2b+3c+4d=30$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to find integer solutions $a$,$b$,$c$,$d\\in\\mathbb{N}$ that satisfy this equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "1. You can assume the solutions are within the interval [0;30].\n",
    "1. As a gene, consider using the list of solution values.\n"
