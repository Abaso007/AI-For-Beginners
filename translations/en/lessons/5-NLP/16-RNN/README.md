# Recurrent Neural Networks

## [Pre-lecture quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/ai/quiz/31)

In previous sections, we used rich semantic representations of text combined with a simple linear classifier on top of embeddings. This architecture captures the overall meaning of words in a sentence but does not account for the **order** of words, as the aggregation operation on embeddings removes this information from the original text. Since these models cannot model word order, they struggle with more complex or ambiguous tasks like text generation or question answering.

To understand the meaning of text sequences, we need a different neural network architecture called a **recurrent neural network** (RNN). In an RNN, we process a sentence one symbol at a time through the network, which produces a **state** that is then passed back into the network along with the next symbol.

Given an input sequence of tokens X<sub>0</sub>,...,X<sub>n</sub>, an RNN creates a sequence of neural network blocks and trains this sequence end-to-end using backpropagation. Each network block takes a pair (X<sub>i</sub>,S<sub>i</sub>) as input and produces S<sub>i+1</sub> as output. The final state S<sub>n</sub> (or output Y<sub>n</sub>) is passed to a linear classifier to generate the result. All network blocks share the same weights and are trained end-to-end in a single backpropagation pass.

Because the state vectors S<sub>0</sub>,...,S<sub>n</sub> are passed through the network, it can learn sequential dependencies between words. For instance, when the word *not* appears in the sequence, the network can learn to negate certain elements within the state vector, enabling negation.

> ‚úÖ Since the weights of all RNN blocks in the image above are shared, the same structure can be represented as a single block (on the right) with a recurrent feedback loop that passes the network's output state back to the input.

## Anatomy of an RNN Cell

Let‚Äôs explore the structure of a simple RNN cell. It takes the previous state S<sub>i-1</sub> and the current symbol X<sub>i</sub> as inputs and produces the output state S<sub>i</sub>. Sometimes, we are also interested in another output Y<sub>i</sub>, as in generative networks.

A simple RNN cell contains two weight matrices: one transforms the input symbol (let‚Äôs call it W), and the other transforms the input state (H). The network output is calculated as &sigma;(W&times;X<sub>i</sub>+H&times;S<sub>i-1</sub>+b), where &sigma; is the activation function and b is an additional bias.

In many cases, input tokens are passed through an embedding layer before entering the RNN to reduce dimensionality. If the input vector dimension is *emb_size* and the state vector dimension is *hid_size*, the size of W is *emb_size*&times;*hid_size*, and the size of H is *hid_size*&times;*hid_size*.

## Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)

One major issue with classical RNNs is the **vanishing gradients** problem. Since RNNs are trained end-to-end in a single backpropagation pass, it becomes difficult to propagate errors to the earlier layers of the network, preventing the network from learning relationships between distant tokens. One solution to this problem is **explicit state management** using **gates**. Two popular architectures that implement this are **Long Short Term Memory** (LSTM) and **Gated Relay Unit** (GRU).

The LSTM network is similar to an RNN but passes two states between layers: the actual state C and the hidden vector H. At each unit, the hidden vector H<sub>i</sub> is concatenated with the input X<sub>i</sub>, and together they control the state C via **gates**. Each gate is a neural network with sigmoid activation (output range [0,1]), which acts like a bitwise mask when multiplied by the state vector. The gates (from left to right in the image above) are:

* The **forget gate** determines which components of the vector C should be forgotten and which should be retained.
* The **input gate** extracts information from the input and hidden vectors and inserts it into the state.
* The **output gate** transforms the state via a linear layer with *tanh* activation and selects certain components using the hidden vector H<sub>i</sub> to produce a new state C<sub>i+1</sub>.

The components of state C can be thought of as flags that can be toggled on or off. For example, encountering the name *Alice* in a sequence might raise a flag indicating a female noun. Later, encountering the phrase *and Tom* might raise a flag indicating a plural noun. By manipulating the state, the network can track grammatical properties of sentence parts.

## Bidirectional and Multilayer RNNs

So far, we‚Äôve discussed recurrent networks that process sequences in one direction, from start to finish. This approach feels natural since it mimics how we read or listen to speech. However, in many practical scenarios, we have random access to the input sequence, making it useful to run recurrent computations in both directions. Such networks are called **bidirectional** RNNs. In bidirectional networks, two hidden state vectors are maintained‚Äîone for each direction.

A recurrent network, whether unidirectional or bidirectional, captures patterns within a sequence and stores them in a state vector or passes them to the output. Similar to convolutional networks, we can stack another recurrent layer on top of the first to capture higher-level patterns based on the low-level patterns extracted by the first layer. This leads to the concept of a **multi-layer RNN**, which consists of two or more recurrent networks, where the output of one layer serves as the input to the next.
