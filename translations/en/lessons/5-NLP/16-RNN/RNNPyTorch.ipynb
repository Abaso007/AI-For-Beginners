    "## Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main issues with classical RNNs is the so-called **vanishing gradients** problem. Since RNNs are trained end-to-end in a single backpropagation pass, it becomes difficult to propagate errors to the earlier layers of the network. As a result, the network struggles to learn relationships between distant tokens. One way to address this issue is by introducing **explicit state management** through the use of **gates**. Two of the most well-known architectures that use this approach are **Long Short Term Memory** (LSTM) and **Gated Relay Unit** (GRU).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image showing an example long short term memory cell](../../../../../lessons/5-NLP/16-RNN/images/long-short-term-memory-cell.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The LSTM network is structured similarly to an RNN, but it passes two states from layer to layer: the actual state $c$ and the hidden vector $h$. At each unit, the hidden vector $h_i$ is concatenated with the input $x_i$, and together they control what happens to the state $c$ through **gates**. Each gate is a neural network with a sigmoid activation function (output in the range $[0,1]$), which can be thought of as a bitwise mask when multiplied by the state vector. The following gates are present (from left to right in the image above):\n",
    "* **Forget gate**: Takes the hidden vector and determines which components of the vector $c$ should be forgotten and which should be retained.\n",
    "* **Input gate**: Extracts some information from the input and hidden vector and inserts it into the state.\n",
    "* **Output gate**: Transforms the state using a linear layer with $\\tanh$ activation, then selects certain components using the hidden vector $h_i$ to produce the new state $c_{i+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The components of the state $c$ can be thought of as flags that can be turned on or off. For example, when encountering the name *Alice* in a sequence, we might assume it refers to a female character and set a flag in the state to indicate the presence of a female noun in the sentence. Later, when encountering the phrase *and Tom*, we might set a flag to indicate the presence of a plural noun. By manipulating the state in this way, we can theoretically keep track of the grammatical properties of different parts of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: A fantastic resource for understanding the inner workings of LSTMs is the article [Understanding LSTM Networks](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) by Christopher Olah.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the internal structure of an LSTM cell may seem complex, PyTorch abstracts this implementation within the `LSTMCell` class and provides the `LSTM` object to represent the entire LSTM layer. As a result, implementing an LSTM classifier is quite similar to the simple RNN we discussed earlier:\n"

A packed sequence is thus represented as a single vectorâ€”in this case, `[1,6,9,2,7,3,8,4,5]`â€”along with a length vector (`[5,3,1]`), from which the original padded minibatch can easily be reconstructed.\n",

    "## Bidirectional and Multilayer RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "In our examples, all recurrent networks operated in a single direction, from the start of a sequence to its end. This seems natural because it mirrors how we read or listen to speech. However, in many practical scenarios, we have random access to the input sequence, so it might make sense to perform recurrent computation in both directions. Such networks are called **bidirectional** RNNs, and they can be created by passing the `bidirectional=True` parameter to the RNN/LSTM/GRU constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with a bidirectional network, we need two hidden state vectorsâ€”one for each direction. PyTorch encodes these vectors as a single vector with double the size, which is quite convenient. This is because you typically pass the resulting hidden state to a fully connected linear layer, and you only need to account for the increased size when creating the layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurrent network, whether one-directional or bidirectional, captures certain patterns within a sequence and can store them in the state vector or pass them to the output. Similar to convolutional networks, we can stack another recurrent layer on top of the first one to capture higher-level patterns, built from the low-level patterns extracted by the first layer. This brings us to the concept of a **multi-layer RNN**, which consists of two or more recurrent networks, where the output of one layer is passed as input to the next layer.\n",

    "\n",
    "PyTorch makes constructing such networks straightforward. You simply need to pass the `num_layers` parameter to the RNN/LSTM/GRU constructor to automatically build multiple layers of recurrence. This also means that the size of the hidden/state vector will increase proportionally, and youâ€™ll need to account for this when processing the output of the recurrent layers.\n"
