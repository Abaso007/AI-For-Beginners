    "Although TF-IDF representations assign frequency weights to different words, they cannot capture meaning or order. As the renowned linguist J. R. Firth stated in 1935, “The complete meaning of a word is always contextual, and no study of meaning apart from context can be taken seriously.” Later in the course, we will explore how to extract contextual information from text using language modeling.\n"
