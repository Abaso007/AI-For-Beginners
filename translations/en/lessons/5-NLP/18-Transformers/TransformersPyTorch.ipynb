    "# Attention mechanisms and transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "One major limitation of recurrent networks is that all words in a sequence are treated as having the same influence on the result. This leads to suboptimal performance in standard LSTM encoder-decoder models for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition and Machine Translation. In reality, certain words in the input sequence often have a greater impact on the sequential outputs than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a sequence-to-sequence model, such as machine translation. It is implemented using two recurrent networks: one network (**encoder**) compresses the input sequence into a hidden state, and another network (**decoder**) expands this hidden state into the translated output. The issue with this approach is that the final state of the network struggles to retain information from the beginning of a sentence, resulting in poor model performance on longer sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention Mechanisms** offer a way to assign varying levels of importance to each input vector when predicting each output of the RNN. This is achieved by creating shortcuts between the intermediate states of the input RNN and the output RNN. In this way, when generating the output symbol $y_t$, all input hidden states $h_i$ are considered, each with a different weight coefficient $\\alpha_{t,i}$.\n",

    "Attention mechanisms are a key factor behind much of the current or near-current state-of-the-art advancements in Natural Language Processing. However, adding attention significantly increases the number of model parameters, which led to scalability challenges with RNNs. A major limitation of scaling RNNs is their sequential nature, which makes it difficult to batch and parallelize training. In an RNN, each element of a sequence must be processed in order, making parallelization impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adoption of attention mechanisms, combined with this limitation, led to the development of the now state-of-the-art Transformer Models, which are widely used today in models like BERT and OpenGPT3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformer models\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of passing the context of each previous prediction into the next evaluation step, **transformer models** use **positional encodings** and attention to capture the context of a given input within a specified window of text. The image below illustrates how positional encodings combined with attention can capture context within a given window.\n",

    "![Animated GIF showing how the evaluations are performed in transformer models.](../../../../../lessons/5-NLP/18-Transformers/images/transformer-animated-explanation.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each input position is mapped independently to each output position, transformers can parallelize more effectively than RNNs, enabling much larger and more expressive language models. Each attention head can learn different relationships between words, enhancing downstream Natural Language Processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a large multi-layer transformer network with 12 layers for *BERT-base* and 24 layers for *BERT-large*. The model is first pre-trained on a large corpus of text data (Wikipedia + books) using unsupervised training (predicting masked words in a sentence). During pre-training, the model acquires a significant level of language understanding, which can then be leveraged with other datasets through fine-tuning. This process is known as **transfer learning**.\n",
