# Assignment: Transformers

Experiment with Transformers on HuggingFace! Try out some of the scripts they provide to work with the various models available on their site: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/run_scripts. Use one of their datasets, then import one of your own from this curriculum or from Kaggle and see if you can generate interesting texts. Create a notebook with your findings.
