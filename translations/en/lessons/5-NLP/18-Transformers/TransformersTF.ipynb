    "# Attention mechanisms and transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "One major limitation of recurrent networks is that all words in a sequence are treated as having the same influence on the result. This leads to suboptimal performance in standard LSTM encoder-decoder models for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition and Machine Translation. In reality, certain words in the input sequence often have a greater impact on the sequential outputs than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a sequence-to-sequence model, such as machine translation. It is implemented using two recurrent networks: one network (**encoder**) compresses the input sequence into a hidden state, and another network (**decoder**) expands this hidden state into the translated output. The issue with this approach is that the final state of the network struggles to retain information from the beginning of a sentence, resulting in poor model performance on longer sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention Mechanisms** offer a way to assign different levels of importance to each input vector when predicting each output of the RNN. This is achieved by creating shortcuts between the intermediate states of the input RNN and the output RNN. In this way, when generating the output symbol $y_t$, all input hidden states $h_i$ are considered, but with varying weight coefficients $\\alpha_{t,i}$.\n",

    "Attention mechanisms are responsible for much of the current or near-current state-of-the-art advancements in Natural Language Processing. However, adding attention significantly increases the number of model parameters, which led to scaling challenges with RNNs. A key limitation of scaling RNNs is that their sequential nature makes it difficult to batch and parallelize training. In an RNN, each element of a sequence must be processed in order, which prevents easy parallelization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adoption of attention mechanisms, combined with this limitation, led to the development of the now state-of-the-art Transformer Models that we use today, from BERT to OpenGPT3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transformer models\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of passing the context of each previous prediction into the next evaluation step, **transformer models** use **positional encodings** and **attention** to capture the context of a given input within a specified window of text. The image below illustrates how positional encodings combined with attention can capture context within a given window.\n",

    "![Animated GIF showing how the evaluations are performed in transformer models.](../../../../../lessons/5-NLP/18-Transformers/images/transformer-animated-explanation.gif) \n",
    "\n",
    "Since each input position is mapped independently to each output position, transformers can parallelize much better than RNNs, enabling the creation of larger and more expressive language models. Each attention head can learn different relationships between words, enhancing performance in downstream Natural Language Processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Simple Transformer Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras does not include a built-in Transformer layer, but we can construct one ourselves. As before, we will focus on text classification using the AG News dataset. However, it is worth noting that Transformer models achieve their best results on more complex NLP tasks.\n"

This is because BERT already has a strong understanding of language structure, and we only need to fine-tune the final classifier. However, since BERT is a large model, the entire training process is time-consuming and demands significant computational resources! (GPU, and ideally more than one).\n",

However, understanding the fundamental principles of recurrent neural networks discussed in this module is crucial if you aim to develop advanced neural models.\n"
