# Game Jam

Games are a field that has been significantly impacted by advancements in AI and ML. For this assignment, write a brief essay about a game you enjoy that has been shaped by the progression of AI technology. The game should be old enough to have been influenced by various types of computer processing systems. A good example would be Chess or Go, but you could also consider video games like Pong or Pac-Man. Your essay should explore the game's history, its current state, and its potential future with AI.
