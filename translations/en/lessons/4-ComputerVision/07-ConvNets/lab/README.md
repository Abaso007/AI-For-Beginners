# Classification of Pets Faces

Lab Assignment from [AI for Beginners Curriculum](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-for-beginners).

## Task

Imagine you need to develop an application for a pet nursery to catalog all pets. One of the key features of such an application would be automatically identifying the breed from a photograph. This can be effectively achieved using neural networks.

Your task is to train a convolutional neural network to classify different breeds of cats and dogs using the **Pet Faces** dataset.

## The Dataset

We will use the **Pet Faces** dataset, which is derived from the [Oxford-IIIT](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) pets dataset. It includes 35 different breeds of dogs and cats.

![Dataset we will deal with](../../../../../../translated_images/data.50b2a9d5484bdbf0f52f5765b381cec9efe2bd296a98f007f90bedb6ac67f2a8.en.png)

To download the dataset, use this code snippet:

```python
!wget https://thor.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/images.tar.gz
!tar xfz images.tar.gz
!rm images.tar.gz
```

## Starting Notebook

Begin the lab by opening [PetFaces.ipynb](PetFaces.ipynb)

## Takeaway

You have tackled a fairly complex problem of image classification from scratch! Despite the large number of classes, you were able to achieve reasonable accuracy! Itâ€™s also a good idea to measure top-k accuracy, as some classes can be easily confused, even by humans, due to their subtle differences.
