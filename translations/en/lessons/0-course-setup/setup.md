# Getting Started with this Curriculum

## Are you a student?

Start with these resources:

* [Student Hub page](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/student-hub?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-cacaste) This page offers beginner resources, student packs, and even opportunities to get a free certification voucher. It's a page worth bookmarking and revisiting regularly, as we update the content at least once a month.
* [Microsoft Student Learn ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-cacaste) Join a global community of student ambassadors—this could be your gateway to Microsoft.

**Students**, there are a few ways to use this curriculum. You can simply read the text and explore the code directly on GitHub. If you'd like to run the code in any of the notebooks, [read our instructions](./etc/how-to-run.md) and find additional tips in [this blog post](https://soshnikov.com/education/how-to-execute-notebooks-from-github/).

## Self Study

If you'd like to take this course as a self-study project, we recommend forking the entire repository to your own GitHub account and completing the exercises on your own or with a group:

* Start with a pre-lecture quiz.
* Read the introductory text for the lecture.
* If the lecture includes additional notebooks, go through them, reading and running the code. If both TensorFlow and PyTorch notebooks are provided, you can focus on one—choose the framework you prefer.
* Notebooks often include challenges that encourage you to modify the code and experiment.
* Take the post-lecture quiz.
* If the module includes a lab, complete the assignment.
* Visit the [Discussion board](https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners/discussions) to "learn out loud."

> For further study, we recommend exploring these [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/dmitrysoshnikov-9132/collections/31zgizg2p418yo/?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-cacaste) modules and learning paths.

**Teachers**, we have [included some suggestions](/for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum.

## Pedagogy

We followed two key teaching principles while designing this curriculum: making it **project-based** and including **frequent quizzes**.

By aligning the content with projects, the learning process becomes more engaging for students, and their understanding of concepts is reinforced. Additionally, a low-stakes quiz before class helps students focus on the topic, while a second quiz after class further solidifies their knowledge. This curriculum is designed to be flexible and enjoyable, and it can be completed in its entirety or in parts. The projects start small and gradually increase in complexity over the 12-week cycle.

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are available [in this app](https://red-field-0a6ddfd03.1.azurestaticapps.net/), with a total of 50 quizzes, each containing three questions. They are linked within the lessons, but the quiz app can also be run locally; follow the instructions in the `etc/quiz-app` folder.

## Offline access

You can access this documentation offline using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). Fork this repository, [install Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) on your local machine, and then, in the root folder of this repository, type `docsify serve`. The website will be served on port 3000 on your localhost: `localhost:3000`. A PDF version of the curriculum is available [at this link](../../../../../../../../../etc/pdf/readme.pdf).
