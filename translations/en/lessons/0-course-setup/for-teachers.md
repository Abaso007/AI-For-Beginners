# For Educators

Would you like to use this curriculum in your classroom? Feel free to do so!

In fact, you can utilize it directly within GitHub by using GitHub Classroom.

To get started, fork this repository. You'll need to create a separate repository for each lesson, so you'll need to extract each folder into its own repository. This way, [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) can handle each lesson individually.

These [detailed instructions](https://github.blog/2020-03-18-set-up-your-digital-classroom-with-github-classroom/) will guide you on how to set up your classroom.

## Using the repository as is

If you'd prefer to use this repository as it currently exists, without involving GitHub Classroom, that's also an option. You'll need to coordinate with your students on which lesson to work through together.

In an online setting (Zoom, Teams, or similar platforms), you could create breakout rooms for quizzes and mentor students to prepare them for learning. Then, invite students to complete the quizzes and submit their answers as 'issues' at a designated time. You could follow the same approach for assignments if you want students to collaborate openly.

If you'd rather use a more private format, ask your students to fork the curriculum, lesson by lesson, into their own private GitHub repositories and grant you access. This way, they can complete quizzes and assignments privately and submit them to you via issues on your classroom repository.

There are many ways to adapt this for an online classroom environment. Let us know what works best for you!
