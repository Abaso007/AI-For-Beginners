# Build an Ontology

Creating a knowledge base involves organizing a model that represents facts about a specific topic. Choose a topic—such as a person, a place, or an object—and construct a model for it. Apply some of the techniques and strategies for model-building discussed in this lesson. For instance, you could create an ontology for a living room, including furniture, lighting, and other elements. What distinguishes the living room from the kitchen? The bathroom? How can you identify it as a living room rather than a dining room? Use [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) to develop your ontology.
