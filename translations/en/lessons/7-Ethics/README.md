# Ethical and Responsible AI

You’re almost at the end of this course, and by now, I hope it’s clear that AI is built on a foundation of formal mathematical methods that help us identify patterns in data and train models to mimic certain aspects of human behavior. At this point in time, AI is considered a powerful tool for extracting patterns from data and applying them to solve new challenges.

In science fiction, however, AI is often portrayed as a threat to humanity. These stories typically revolve around scenarios where AI rebels against humans, suggesting that AI possesses emotions or can make decisions beyond what its creators intended.

The AI we’ve studied in this course is essentially advanced matrix arithmetic. It’s a highly effective tool for solving problems, but like any powerful tool, it can be used for both good and harmful purposes. Crucially, it can also be *misused*.

## Principles of Responsible AI

To prevent accidental or intentional misuse of AI, Microsoft has outlined key [Principles of Responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai?WT.mc_id=academic-77998-cacaste). These principles are based on the following concepts:

* **Fairness** addresses the critical issue of *model biases*, which can arise from using biased data during training. For instance, if we’re predicting the likelihood of someone getting a software developer job, the model might favor males simply because the training data was skewed toward a male demographic. It’s essential to carefully balance training data, examine the model for biases, and ensure it considers more relevant features.
* **Reliability and Safety**. AI models, by their nature, can make errors. Neural networks provide probabilities, and we must account for this when making decisions. Every model has specific precision and recall metrics, and understanding these is vital to avoid harm caused by incorrect recommendations.
* **Privacy and Security** have unique implications in AI. For example, when data is used to train a model, it becomes somewhat "embedded" in the model. While this can enhance security and privacy, it’s important to keep track of the data used for training.
* **Inclusiveness** emphasizes that AI is not meant to replace people but to enhance human capabilities and foster creativity. It also ties into fairness, as datasets involving underrepresented communities are often biased. We must ensure these communities are properly represented and treated fairly by AI systems.
* **Transparency** involves being upfront about the use of AI. Additionally, wherever possible, we should aim to use AI systems that are *interpretable*.
* **Accountability**. When AI models make decisions, it’s not always clear who is responsible for those outcomes. It’s crucial to establish accountability for AI-driven decisions. In most cases, it’s preferable to involve humans in the decision-making process to ensure accountability rests with actual people.

## Tools for Responsible AI

Microsoft has created the [Responsible AI Toolbox](https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-toolbox), which includes a suite of tools:

* Interpretability Dashboard (InterpretML)
* Fairness Dashboard (FairLearn)
* Error Analysis Dashboard
* Responsible AI Dashboard, which features:

   - EconML: A tool for Causal Analysis that focuses on "what-if" scenarios
   - DiCE: A tool for Counterfactual Analysis that helps identify which features need to change to influence a model’s decision
