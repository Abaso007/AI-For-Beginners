# Classification with PyTorch/TensorFlow

Lab Assignment from [AI for Beginners Curriculum](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-for-beginners).

## Task

Solve two classification problems using single and multi-layered fully-connected networks with PyTorch or TensorFlow:

1. **[Iris classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)** problem - an example of a problem with tabular input data, which can also be addressed using classical machine learning. Your goal is to classify irises into 3 categories based on 4 numerical features.
2. **MNIST** handwritten digit classification problem, which we have encountered before.

Experiment with different network architectures to achieve the highest accuracy possible.

## Starting Notebook
