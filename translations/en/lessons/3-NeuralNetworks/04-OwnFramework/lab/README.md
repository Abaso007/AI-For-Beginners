# MNIST Classification with Our Own Framework

Lab Assignment from [AI for Beginners Curriculum](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-for-beginners).

## Task

Solve the MNIST handwritten digit classification problem using 1-, 2-, and 3-layer perceptrons. Use the neural network framework developed during the lesson.

## Starting Notebook

Begin the lab by opening [MyFW_MNIST.ipynb](MyFW_MNIST.ipynb)

## Questions

After completing this lab, try to answer the following questions:

- Does the activation function between layers impact the network's performance?
- Is a 2- or 3-layer network necessary for this task?
- Did you encounter any difficulties training the network, especially as the number of layers increased?
- How do the network's weights behave during training? You can plot the maximum absolute value of weights against epochs to analyze the relationship.
